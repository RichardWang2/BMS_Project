# Streamlined Image Processing for Protein Crystallization

This is a project I collaborated with Bristol Myers Squibb in a Capstone Project during my last semester in Carnegie Mellon University's Masters of Science in Data Analytics program.

## Overview

The end goal of the project is to create a phase diagram that shows the concentration type which inhibits protein crystallization for every protein type. The approach is to use a image classification model to classify a protein as the following classes: **pure crystal, empty drop, clear drop** and **others**.
